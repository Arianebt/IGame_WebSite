        During today's PlayStation State of Play, Sony's first event of 2023, some exciting new gameplay footage of the
        highly anticipated Resident Evil 4 remake was showcased. Furthermore, it was announced that a special demo for
        the game would be released soon, and fans were ecstatic to hear that the beloved Mercenaries mode from the
        original game would be making a return after beating the main campaign.

        Sony gave us a sneak peek at new gameplay footage of the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. Among the highlights
        was the reveal of a boss fight with Jack Krauser, one of the game's most memorable antagonists. We also caught a
        glimpse of Ada Wong, as well as some more footage of Luis, who was seen alongside Leon in the minecart section.
      </p>
      <p> Mark your calendars for March 24, 2023, as Resident Evil 4 will be available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5,
        Windows, and Xbox Series X/S. Also, a free VR mode exclusive to PSVR 2 is in development, which Capcom announced
        earlier this week.
